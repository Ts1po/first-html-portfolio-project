<h3>Godfather</h3>
<p>
    The Godfather "Don" Vito Corleone is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. 
    He is at the event of his daughter's wedding. Michael, Vito's youngest son and a decorated 
    WW II Marine is also present at the wedding. Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part 
    of the family business. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect 
    but is ruthless against those who do not. But when a powerful and treacherous rival wants to 
    sell drugs and needs the Don's influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it. What follows is 
    a clash between Vito's fading old values and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the thing 
    he was most reluctant in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families which could 
    tear the Corleone family apart.
